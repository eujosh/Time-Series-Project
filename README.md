Information for the projects
Work is to be done by a group of roughly 5 persons.
Take a data, real or simulated, and conduct research using the toolkit from this course.
Your report may include following steps:
1.	Formulate (and motivate) a question;
2.	Take real (or simulate) a dataset;
3.	Make a pre-estimation analysis (visual inspection, ACF, PACF, EACF, stationarity tests, etc.);
4.	Obtain, present, and discuss the estimates (make sure that your specification is correct: neither under-, nor overidentified);
5.	Make a post-estimation analysis (e.g., IRF), discuss the results;
6.	Make a forecast based on the estimates;
7.	General discussion of the results.
